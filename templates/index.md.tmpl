# RedisDB Provider

The RedisDB provider provides resources to interact with a Redis Database.

This provider can't create redis instances, but is instead designed to connect to them and read/write data. This allows reading data
from redis that might be useful in other Terraform configuration, or writing data to redis that was generated by other Terrafom resources.
