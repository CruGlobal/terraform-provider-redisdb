# RedisDB Provider

The RedisDB provider provides resources to interact with a Redis Database.

This provider can't create redis instances, but is instead designed to connect to them and read/write data. This allows reading data
from redis that might be useful in other Terraform configuration, or writing data to redis that was generated by other Terrafom resources.

This provider currently only supports Redis Hashes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Provider with default values
provider "redisdb" {
  hostname = "127.0.0.1"
  port     = "6379"
  database = "0"
}
```
